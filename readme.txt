Hello,

  This file includes some methods I tried to improve my existing NN model:
  
     -mini batching
     -batch normalization
     -hyperparameter tuning by using tensorflow.keras.wrappers.scikit_learn module
     -learning rate decay by using callbacks
     -regularization (l2 and dropout)
     
  Increasing test accuracy was not my main motivation. I tried and experienced various improvement methods which I learned from theoretical lectures.
